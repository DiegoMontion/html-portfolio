<h1>The Best Movies According to Diego</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>

<h3>The Game</h3>
<p>I really felt I was the main character.</p>
<h3>Dr. House</h3>
<p>I like the way an annoying doctor refuses to be hipocritical and therefore acts as a jerk.</p>
<h3>Squid Game</h3>
<p>Real terror.</p>
